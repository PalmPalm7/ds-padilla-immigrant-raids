1. Create a new directory in your local computer and open it in the python editor. 
   Open the terminal and create the virtual environment in your directory: 
     cd /path/to/your/directory
     python -m venv myenv

2. Now you should see some files called myenv, bin in your directory. Then download everything from the Github.

3. Here is the Google Search Key we use: https://serpapi.com/search-api
   Go to https://serpapi.com/ to sign in, then go to https://serpapi.com/manage-api-key to generate Google Search API key and add billing information

4. Go to https://openai.com/index/openai-api to sign up, then go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys to create OpenAI API key and add billing information

5. Replace with your own API keys in api_keys.env

6. Activate virtual environment: source myenv/bin/activate

7. Install packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

8. If step 5 doesn't work, then try line by line: pip install requests pip install beautifulsoup4 pip install openai pip install google-search-results pip install serpapi

9. python main.py
