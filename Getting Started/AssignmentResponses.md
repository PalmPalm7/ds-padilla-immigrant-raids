What questions can and can't be answered with the data you have. 
    Using the data we have, we can see trends related to number of arrests per county as well as per state. By creating various visualizations, we can identify which states and counties have the highest arrest frequencies. We can also use time series data to observe when the arrests are occuring and if there is a pattern related to this. Additionally, we can look at demographic data such as nationality and gender to see if there are trends between the people being arrested in various operations. 

What other data do you need and how will you get access to it?
    Since this project is based off of documents related to occurences of immigration raids, additional data will need to be scraped from the web. The goal is to automate this process using LLM, potentially. This would aid in the web scraping process and increase efficiency. Also, having more data would help make up for the missing data throughout our dataset.
